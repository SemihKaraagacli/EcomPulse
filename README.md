# Ecompulse: A Modern E-Commerce Platform
Ecompulse is an e-commerce platform I am developing using **.NET 8** for the backend and **Angular 19** for the frontend. The application leverages **JWT authentication** for user identity verification and **Client Credential Token** mechanisms to secure API access. Additionally, role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to restrict page access based on user roles.
## Features

### User Functionality

- Products can be listed based on **categories**.
- Users can **view detailed information** about products by clicking on them.
### Advanced Search and Categorization

### Modern and Secure Design
